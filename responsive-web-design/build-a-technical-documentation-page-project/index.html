                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and
                        page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                    types are not explicitly typed.

                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:
                </p>
                <code>
            function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } greetMe("World");
          </code>
                <p>
                    When the above code is executed, it will pop up a greeting alert box that says "Hello World".

                <p>
                    Before you can use a variable, you must declare it with the var keyword. The var keyword tells the
                    interpreter to create a new variable with the specified name. The following example declares a
                    variable called quantity:
                </p>
                <code>
            var quantity;
          </code>
                <p>
                    You can also declare multiple variables in a single statement, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
            var quantity, price, total;
          </code>
                <p>
                    You can assign a value to a variable as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
            var quantity = 25;
          </code>
                <p>
                    You can assign a value to more than one variable in a single statement, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
            var price = 5, quantity = 14;
          </code>
                <p>
                    You can assign a value to a variable using an expression, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
            var price = 5;
            var quantity = 14;
            var total = price * quantity;
          </code>
                <p>
                    You can assign a value to a variable using a function call, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
            var price = 5;
            var quantity = 14;
            var total = price * quantity;
          </code>

                <code>
            var price = 5;
            var quantity = 14;
            var total = price * quantity;

            var quantity = 14;
            var total = price * quantity;

            A constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed through re-assignment and whose scope can't be redeclared while the script is running. In JavaScript, constants are created by using the const keyword instead of let or var. The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, in the case where the content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its parameters) can be altered.
